# Vimuser dbernard

My personalized Vim setup built on [jszakmeister's vimuser][vimuser-jszakmeister]
and [drmikehenry's vimfiles][vimfiles].

## Useful Packages

Until I try to hack together some setup script that will do this for me, this is
just a useful list of additional deps for this setup. Note that this is not an
extensive list, just the tools I find myself using out of all of the great tools
included in this Vim setup. This list will grow as I take advantage of more of
the plugins in this setup.

### Ubuntu
 - wmctrl
 - vim-gnome
 - exuberant-ctags

### Python
 - `python2 -m pip install flake8`
